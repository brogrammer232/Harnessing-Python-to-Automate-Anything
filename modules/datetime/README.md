#`datetime`

The **`datetime` module** is part of Pythonâ€™s standard library and provides classes and functions for working with dates and times. It enables programs to represent, manipulate, and format temporal data at different levels of precision; from whole days to fractions of a second.

---

## Purpose and Capabilities

The module is designed to:

* Represent calendar dates, times of day, or full timestamps.
* Perform arithmetic with dates and times (e.g., differences, offsets, durations).
* Handle conversions between different representations, such as formatted strings and structured objects.
* Support time zones and daylight saving transitions through its `tzinfo` framework.

---

## Core Classes

The module consists of several closely related classes:

* **`date`**: Represents a calendar date (year, month, day).
* **`time`**: Represents a time of day, independent of any date (hour, minute, second, microsecond, with optional time zone).
* **`datetime`**: Combines `date` and `time` into a single object, representing an exact point in time.
* **`timedelta`**: Represents the difference between two dates or times (a duration).
* **`tzinfo`**: Abstract base class for time zone information.
* **`timezone`**: A concrete implementation of `tzinfo` for fixed UTC offsets.

---

## Common Use Cases

* Retrieving the **current date and time** (`datetime.now()`).
* **Formatting and parsing** strings into date-time objects (`strftime`, `strptime`).
* **Computing differences** between two dates (yielding a `timedelta`).
* **Shifting** a date or time forward or backward by a defined duration.
* Working with **time zones** for global or localized applications.
