# Documentation Practices in Software Development

## 1. Introduction

Documentation plays a pivotal role in software engineering. While source code communicates computational logic to a machine, documentation communicates intent, design rationale, and usage guidelines to human readers. Effective documentation improves code maintainability, facilitates onboarding of new contributors, and ensures that future modifications can be made with minimal risk of error. The central question for many developers is not whether to document code, but **how** and **when** documentation should be produced to balance clarity with efficiency.

## 2. When to Document

### 2.1 During Development

Documentation should ideally be written **concurrently with code development**, particularly when the logic, assumptions, or data structures are not immediately self-evident. Writing documentation at the point of implementation ensures accuracy, since the rationale is still fresh in the developer’s mind.

### 2.2 After Feature Stabilization

Following the stabilization of a feature or module, documentation should be revisited to ensure that it provides clear and coherent descriptions. Early-stage drafts may contain tentative notes, while post-stabilization documentation should be refined to match finalized behavior.

### 2.3 During Refactoring and Maintenance

Code refactoring often introduces changes in logic, structure, or dependencies. During this process, outdated documentation should be updated or removed. Stale documentation that no longer reflects the system’s reality introduces risk, as readers may trust misleading descriptions. In this sense, maintaining documentation is as important as maintaining code.

## 3. How to Document

### 3.1 Docstrings (Formal Internal Documentation)

Docstrings constitute the canonical form of documentation within Python and many other programming languages. They provide structured explanations of the purpose and behavior of functions, classes, and modules. A well-written docstring should describe:

* **Purpose**: Why the function or module exists.
* **Parameters**: Type, meaning, and constraints of input values.
* **Return Values**: Data types and meanings of outputs.
* **Exceptions/Assumptions**: Special conditions or invariants the caller must respect.

**Example**:

```python
def schedule_reviews(start_date, intervals):
    """
    Generate review dates based on a starting point and a list of intervals.

    Args:
        start_date (datetime.date): The initial study or learning date.
        intervals (list[int]): A list of intervals, expressed in days, at which
            reviews should occur. Values must be strictly non-negative.

    Returns:
        list[datetime.date]: A chronologically ordered list of review dates.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any interval is negative or if the list is unsorted.

    Note:
        This function assumes that `intervals` are sorted in ascending order.
    """
```

Such documentation aids both users of the function and tools such as IDEs and automated documentation generators (e.g., Sphinx).

### 3.2 Inline Comments (Contextual Clarification)

Inline comments provide micro-level documentation that explains non-trivial implementation details. They should be employed sparingly and reserved for code whose intention is not obvious from its structure or naming.

**Appropriate Usage**:

```python
# Using a set for O(1) average lookup time rather than O(n) list scanning
seen_items = set()
```

**Inappropriate Usage** (redundant commentary):

```python
x = x + 1  # Increment x by 1
```

---

### 3.3 High-Level Documentation

Beyond docstrings and inline comments, broader forms of documentation provide valuable context:

* **README Files**: Provide installation instructions, usage examples, and a high-level description of the project’s purpose.
* **Design Notes**: Document the rationale behind architectural choices, such as file structures, algorithmic trade-offs, or dependency selections.
* **Conventions and Standards**: For team projects, guidelines on naming, formatting, and testing should be documented to ensure consistency.

---

## 4. Guiding Principles

### 4.1 Emphasize the *Why*, Not Only the *What*

Source code already expresses *what* is being done. Documentation should primarily capture *why* a particular implementation was chosen, including trade-offs, constraints, or assumptions.

### 4.2 Favor Readability Over Excessive Commentary

Documentation should not compensate for poorly structured code. Functions should be decomposed and named clearly, minimizing the need for explanatory comments. If a function requires lengthy inline explanation, it is often an indication that the code should be refactored.

### 4.3 Keep Documentation Synchronised with Code

Outdated documentation introduces risk and confusion. A fundamental principle is that **“incorrect documentation is worse than no documentation.”** Developers should adopt workflows where documentation updates are part of the definition of “done” for every feature or modification.

---

## 5. Conclusion

Effective documentation is not an afterthought but an integral component of professional software engineering. By documenting code as it is written, refining it once features stabilize, and maintaining it during refactoring, developers create systems that remain comprehensible and maintainable over time. Docstrings provide formal explanations, inline comments clarify nuanced implementation details, and high-level documents capture design rationale. Together, these practices ensure that software is not only executable by machines but also intelligible to humans.
