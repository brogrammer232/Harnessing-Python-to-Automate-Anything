## Overview

Provide a brief introduction to what the function does in the context of the `sys` module. Mention if it relates to runtime environment, interpreter state, I/O, recursion, memory, etc.

Explain *why* the function exists:

* What problem does it solve?
* When should a programmer use it instead of alternatives?
* Does it expose low-level interpreter details or high-level abstractions?

---

## Syntax, Parameters, and Return Value

```python
sys.function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
```

* **Parameters**: List them, describe types, optional/required.
* **Return Value**: Specify type and meaning.
* Mention default values and constraints.

---

## Behavior and Effects

* Explain what happens when the function is called.
* Note if it mutates interpreter state, reads environment data, or has side effects (e.g., program termination with `sys.exit`).
* Indicate if it raises any specific exceptions.

---

## Examples

Provide 2-3 progressively complex examples:

1. Basic usage.
2. More advanced scenario.
3. A practical OS-dev or system-level use (if applicable).

---

## Practical Use Cases

* Describe where this function is genuinely useful.
* Mention contexts like debugging, runtime checks, script automation, system introspection, etc.

---

## Best Practices

* How to use it efficiently.
* Guidelines for readability, maintainability, and avoiding misuse.
* If safer or better alternatives exist, mention them.

---

## Common Pitfalls

* Typical errors or misunderstandings when using the function.
* Constraints (platform differences, recursion depth issues, side effects).
* Notes on performance, portability, or deprecation (if relevant).
