## Overview

Briefly describe what the method does, why it exists, and its role in dictionary operations.

---

## Syntax, Parameters, and Return Value

```python
dict.method_name(arguments)
```

* **Parameters**: List parameters with meaning and defaults.
* **Return Value**: State what is returned (object type, `None`, modified dictionary, etc.).

---

## Behavior and Effects

Explain how the method behaves:

* Does it mutate the dictionary in place or return a new object?
* What happens if a key is missing?
* Any order guarantees?

---

## Examples

Provide 2-4 concise examples showing common usage and edge cases.

---

## Practical Use Cases

Explain when and why this method is valuable in real programming scenarios.

---

## Best Practices

Offer recommendations for using the method effectively (e.g., prefer `.get()` over direct indexing when unsure if a key exists).

---

## Common Pitfalls

Warn about mistakes programmers often make:

* Misunderstanding return value
* Confusing mutation vs. copying
* Assuming order guarantees when not present in older versions
